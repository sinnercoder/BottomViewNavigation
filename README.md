Cool BottomNavigationView
==========================

This is an implementation of  BottomNavigationView from android support library

I was using Furlenco app which has this samme bottomnavigation design, so i thought to implement it instead

So this moving strip is drawable vector which was implemnted using dynamic vector drawables to give it cool tab type animation.

To make your Vector Drawable dynamic you can use this cool library

If you like this design you clone it and use it as per your design
